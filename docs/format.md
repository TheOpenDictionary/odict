# The File Format

Compiled odict files are relatively straightforward, as they utilize the [ODict Flatbuffer schema](../schema/schema.fbs).

The buffer generated by this schema take up over 90% of the compiled file, however, addition header information still exists. The table below illustrates the full breakdown of a compiled .odict file, in the order in which the values are written to the file.

All values written in Little Endian byte order.

| Name           | Type    | Bytes    | Description                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Signature      | char[6] | 6        | Signature for the ODict format. Assertions fail if this signature is missing. Should always be `ODICT`. |
| Version        | ushort  | 2        | Represents the major version of ODict with which the file was created.                                  |
| Content Length | long    | 8        | Size (in bytes) of the compressed content to read. Used in assertions to validate file length.          |
| Content        | []byte  | Variable | Snappy-compressed FlatBuffer object. Must be decompressed by Snappy before it can be used.              |

A design decision was made to keep the structural data of the ODict format as a cross-platform [Flatbuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) schema as opposed to simply encoding a
Go struct so that the format could be used by anyone, even without necessarily using any of the core ODict libraries.
